Wind Farm Simulation
OVERVIEW

This project simulates the energy production of a wind farm based on wind conditions, turbine status, and farm size. The simulation covers daily operations such as energy production and turbine maintenance in case of breakdowns due to strong winds.

FEATURES 

    Simulates wind turbine energy production based on daily wind conditions (no wind, moderate wind, strong wind).
    Tracks turbine breakdowns and manages maintenance, including repair time and costs.
    Customizable parameters: wind transition matrix, breakdown probability, energy production levels, number of turbines, maintenance costs, and duration.


PARAMETERS

    Wind Transition Matrix: Controls daily wind speed changes.
    Failure Probability: Set probability p for turbine breakdowns during strong winds.
    Energy Production Levels: Define energy output for each wind condition (none, moderate, strong).
    Maintenance: Customize duration (3 days by default) and costs (â‚¬150,000 per maintenance).

RESULTS

The simulation outputs include:

    Total energy production over the period.
    Maximum and minimum daily production.
    Maintenance costs and breakdown statistics.


USAGE

    Launch the simulation.
