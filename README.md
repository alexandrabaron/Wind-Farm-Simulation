Wind Farm Simulation
OVERVIEW

This project simulates the energy production of a wind farm based on wind conditions, turbine status, and farm size. The simulation covers daily operations such as energy production and turbine maintenance in case of breakdowns due to strong winds.
Features

    Wind Simulation: Wind conditions vary daily based on a transition matrix.
    Energy Production: Turbines produce energy depending on the wind speed (low, moderate, or strong).
    Maintenance System: Turbines can break down in strong winds and require maintenance, which affects energy production and incurs costs.
    Configurable Parameters: Wind transition probabilities, breakdown likelihood, production rates, and farm size can be customized.
